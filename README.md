##### Disclaimer:

This program is still in progress and is currently in a **NOT WORKING** condition. This is due to the fact that ant does not support taking in inputs in command line thus a GUI implementation is needed for this program to function as intended.

## Setting up and running it

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/binhonglee/TicketingSystem.git
$ cd TicketingSystem
$ ant execute
```
