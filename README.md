## Bus Ticket Management System

This program is written solely on personal time with the purpose to pick up the C++ programming language once again after a long long time since I last wrote anything with it.

The original version of this program (as seen in the initial commit) was a version of my work years ago. I decided that starting from scratch might not be the best idea when it comes to a programming language that I haven't use for a long time. However, as years pass, there are different things that I've learn from other programming languages that I thought would be fun to see how that implementation works with C++ so it will eventually be very much different from what it was.

Thank you for your time in reading this. I sure hope someone would find this useful in someway someday.

BinHong Lee.
